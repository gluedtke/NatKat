*Calculate the mean rate of events from a set of data containing counts of these events via Bayes' Rule.*

In order to calculate the mean rate of events from a data set that contains the number of counts of these events in a fixed time interval you have to use the **Poisson distribution** in combination with the **Bayes' Rule**. The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is used for the calculation of the probability of a given number of events "in a fixed interval" assuming that these events are independent and if there is a known expectation average/rate. 

# Data Basis

Landslide data were obtained from the international disaster database (EM-DAT)[https://www.emdat.be/]. The data set includes recorded landslides that occurred in China from 1980 to 2017. The number of landslides per year is given (condition for using Poisson distribution).

After importing the obtained CSV-file in R by using ´´´read.csv()```, a vector containing the number of landslides per year is extracted by converting a data frame to a vector. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
#import csv file
dat <- read.csv("china_landslides.csv", header = TRUE, sep=";")

#select rows and col simultaneously 
dat_ls <- dat[c(42:79),c(1,4)]


#class(dat_ls) #class or type of an object
#str(dat_ls)
#length(dat_ls)

#change class or type of an object
#from data frame to vector
dat_ls_matrix <- as.matrix(dat_ls)
dat_ls_vector <-as.vector(dat_ls_matrix)

#transformation to numeric data
landslide <- as.numeric(dat_ls_vector[39:76]) #occurence from 1980 to 2017

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
landslide <- c(5,  8,  7,  9,  6, 15, 11, 16, 18, 14, 18, 13, 18, 18, 18, 15, 20, 21, 18, 21, 29, 33, 29, 27, 24,
26, 32, 37, 20, 30, 26, 26, 20, 28, 43, 41, 36, 33, 30) 
```


# Basics Calculation

Instead of using static or interactive single values, we are going to use **vectors ** to calculate the posterior-rate (Bayes' Rule).

 $$p(\lambda|D)=\frac{p(D|\lambda) p(\lambda)}{p(D)}$$ 
 
 with
 * D = yearly number of landslides observed in China (from 1980 to 2017)
 * $\lambda$ = means
 

# Definition of Prior and Likelihood

First of all, *Prior* is defined by choosing reasonable values. Before choosing a range of values for $\lambda$, minimum and maximum values of the obtained data are calculated.


```{r,}
min <- min(landslide)
max <- max(landslide)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Minimum: ", min)
cat("Maximum: ", max)
```

The lower limit of prior is set to *0* since years without landslides are possible. Due to the maximum  value of our data, the upper limit is set to *100*. This results in the following vector:

```{r}
#p(lambda)
prior_lambda <- c(0:100)
plot(prior_lambda, type="h")
```
*Gwen: kannst du herausfinden, warum der letzte Strich nicht bei 100 ist? (gilt für den oberen und unteren Plot)*
*Gwen: könnest du auch noch alle Graphiken schöner gestalten: Beschriftung, evtl. breitere Balken, xxxx*
*und am Ende diese Kommentare löschen? :D *
*vielleicht hast du auch noch andere Ideen*

We assume that these data (values for $\lambda$) are equally likely (with more information we could change the probability distribution). 

So a discrete uniform probability distribution (```prior_prob```) is calculated by repeating each probability (1 divided by the total number of possible means/$\lambda$) ``length(prior_lambda)`` times (=length of the vector prior_lambda).
*Gwen: Ist der Satz verständlich?*


```{r}
prior_prob <- rep(1/length(prior_lambda),times = length(prior_lambda)) 

#plot the discrete uniform probability distribution
plot(prior_prob, type="h")
```

In order to define the *Likelihood*, we have to multiply the Poisson distribution for each $\lambda$/mean value since we are assume that the events are independent of each other. The Poisson distribution is calculated by using the function ```dpois()```. The vector containing the yearly number of landslides as well as the prior-vector (means) are the input values.

*Gwen: ??? we are using a loop (runs from minimum to maximum value of lambda, festgelegt durch seq_along).*
*Gwen: what does the result say?*

```{r}
#p(D|k)

#create a vector with the same number of entries as in "prior"
likeli <- rep(NA,length(prior_lambda))

#using a loop for the calculation
for (i in seq_along(prior_lambda))
{
  likeli[i] <- prod(dpois(landslide,i))
}

plot(likeli,typ="h")

```

#Calculation of the Posterior Rate

In order to calculate the **Poterior Rate** we do not have to calculate the **Evidence** but re normalize the product of Likelihood and Prior:


```{r}
bayes_rate <- likeli * prior_prob

bayes_rate <- bayes_rate/ sum(bayes_rate)


plot(bayes_rate, type = "h") 

```

*Gwen: evtl Satz zum result > Shape is exactly the same if flat probability is used > What does we see and why?*
....
